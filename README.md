# Richy
Personal assistant made especially for GNU/Linux because we deserve our own version of Siri too!


Did you ever wanted to have your own assistant, but the only ones available are for Android/iOS/Windows plus you are
worried about privacy?

Well, now you can have '**Richy**' which will help you to live in the terminal, because what's the point of searching the web (which can take a while by the way) when you can simply just ask Richy?

Richy is open-source python-based assistant which can help you with;
- maintaining your schedule,
- aswering your questions,
- calculating medium-level calculation,
- giving you informations about your movies library or any movie you want

## Curent version

## Why Richy?
Name 'Richy' is a modification after the name of famous physicist [Heinrich Friedrich Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_F._Weber) which was Albert Einstein's initial doctoral
advisor. As Heinrich was helping Albert Einstein, Richy will help you with day-to-day questions and tasks.
It was made especially for GNU/Linux as members of Linux family also need an assistant, however with few
code modifications, the code should work on Microsoft Windows or MacOS. I've decided to create Richy after
I came across an article where the author was trying to live in the terminal and only use the terminal without any GUI for
30 days. This is nearly impossible without any preparation which is why I created Richy, I wanted to do
nearly everything in the command line without the need for any user interface.

## How can I help?
If you have any ideas on how Richy could be improved or if you found some interesting
script that could be used as module to Richy, just email me; michpcx@protonmail.ch. Also, if you found some
bugs in the code or you have more efficient way of performing a task, just create new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/michpcx/Richy/issues).
